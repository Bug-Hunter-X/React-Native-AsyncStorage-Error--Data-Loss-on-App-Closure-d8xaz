# React Native AsyncStorage Error: Data Loss on App Closure

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native apps when using AsyncStorage: data loss if the app closes before asynchronous storage operations complete.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution using promises and error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to store user data using `AsyncStorage.setItem`.  If the app is closed before the asynchronous operation completes, data may be lost, leading to app crashes or inconsistent data.

## Solution

The solution utilizes promises and error handling to ensure data is written successfully, even if the app closes unexpectedly.  It also incorporates appropriate logging for debugging purposes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe that the app handles the AsyncStorage operation correctly even under interruption conditions, unlike the original example.
